# Population-Averaged vs. Subject-Specific Effects: GLMM and MLM

## Overview
This Shiny app, published at [https://wardeiling.shinyapps.io/GLMM_population-averaged-and-person-specific-interpretations/](https://wardeiling.shinyapps.io/GLMM_population-averaged-and-person-specific-interpretations/), allows you to explore and visualize the differences between population-averaged (PA) and subject-specific (SS) effects in Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) and Mixed Linear Models (MLMs). It lets you interactively adjust model parameters and view how fixed and random effects influence predictions.

## Features
- Interactive exploration of GLMMs and MLMs with continuous and binary predictors.
- Visual comparison of PA and SS effects.
- Dynamic plots updating with parameter changes.

## Usage
1. **Adjust sliders** to modify model parameters (intercepts, slopes, random intercept SD).
2. **Observe** how predictions change at the population and individual levels.
